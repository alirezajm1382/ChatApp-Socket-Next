## Note

For any usage except for development environment, you need to run `node server/server.js` in the terminal separately.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Reminder: The ```server.js``` file is only used for development environment.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This automatically starts the server.js file as well.

## Usage

3. **Send Messages**: Type your message in the input box at the bottom and hit "Send" to share it with other users in the chat.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
